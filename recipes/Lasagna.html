    <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe.</li>

    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, or use oven-ready noodles if preferred.c</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna in a large baking dish by spreading a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li>Add a layer of béchamel sauce on top of the noodles, followed by a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like basil if desired.</li>
